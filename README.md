# üõí Azure-based B2B Product Recommendation System

An end-to-end recommendation engine built on the Azure stack, simulating a B2B use case. It includes customer-specific and item-based recommendations, a Dash-powered internal dashboard.

I wish to demonstrate my skills on the Azure and Databricks platform through this project which I have tried to make as close to real production as possible without data from a real organization.

To make it as realistic as possible, I have asked ChatGPT 4o to act as my product owner and provide me with user stories. From these I have listed features I wish to include in a MVP.
